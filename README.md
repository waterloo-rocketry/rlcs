# Remote Launch Control System

RLCS stands for Remote Launch Control System. It's purpose is to fill our rocket with ethanol and nitrous oxide, then ignite the ignition spacer inside the rocket, all from a distance of 3000' away at launch control. To do so, it has control over multiple valves at the rocket, a linear actuator to disconnect the fill arm from the rocket, and 2 ignition coils inside the ignition spacer.
